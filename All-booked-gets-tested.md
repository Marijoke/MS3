## User stories 
- As an existing reader of books, I want somewhere I can see the books I've read in one place 
    - Each user has profile called my books they can access once they log in that allows them to add books and link to the book's image. Users can also review the books. 
 - As a potential user I want to find new books to read or add to my collection
    - Users can share book lists with other users which helps introduce users to new books they may have not heard of. 
- As a potential user I want to be able to buy a book that interests me quickly
    - Books featured in a shared list includes a purchase link that allows users to quickly buy the books of their choice. 
- As a potential user I want to be able to build relationships with the people that share books via the website. 
    - The website allows you to see who shared the book so superficial relationships can be build with people with the same taste of books as me. Additionally users will be able to engage with each other via our social media. 
- As a user I want something easy to use with no jargon
    - The website features prompts telling you what to do throughout. Once logged in the website has not got many pages or buttons and support is provided through our social media if needed.   
- As a potential user I want something that looks fun and playful
    - The website features bright colours and white text that allows users enjoy the experience and use their imagination just like they do when they read.
