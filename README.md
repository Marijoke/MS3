# All booked
All booked is an online platform for people who love to read. 
Our users are able to create an account that gives them access to a self curated collection of books. 
Users are able create personalised book lists that can be shared with other users. All booked stems from a book and discussion club that I used to attend.

## UX
This website is for:
- People who enjoy reading books
- People who want to curate their collection
- People interested in writing notes or reviews ion the books they have read.
- People interested in getting new book recommendations.
- Companies that may want to use affiliate links for the books linked to stores. 


### Wireframes
I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

[Please see Wireframes here.](INSERT LINK HERE)

### Fonts 
The fonts chosen for the website are:
[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=popp#glyphs) was used for the body offering a Geometric sans serif typeface that is clear to read at every size.
[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?query=nunito#standard-styles) was used for the All booked logo. Nunito is a well balanced sans serif typeface superfamily.

### Colours
I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to look up suitable colour schemes. I wanted colours that complimented each other but were also bold. My selection was limited due to using Materialize which has a selected range of colours that can be added.
